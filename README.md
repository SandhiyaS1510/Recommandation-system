🎯 Smart Recommendation System – AI-Powered Personalized Suggestions!
🚀 An intelligent Recommendation System that suggests movies, books, or products based on user preferences! This project implements Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering, offering personalized recommendations using machine learning techniques.

💡 Ever wondered how Netflix, Amazon, or Spotify suggest what you might like? This project dives into the algorithms behind these systems!

🌟 Features

✅ Collaborative Filtering – Recommends items based on user interactions.

✅ Content-Based Filtering – Analyzes item features to match user preferences.

✅ Hybrid Approach – Combines both for highly accurate suggestions.

✅ GUI & Web App Support – View recommendations with Tkinter (desktop) or Flask (web).

✅ Scalable & Customizable – Supports different datasets (movies, books, e-commerce).

✅ Real-World AI – Learn the logic behind modern recommendation engines.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy for data processing

Scikit-Learn for machine learning models

Flask for a web-based interface

Tkinter for a GUI-based desktop app

Surprise Library for collaborative filtering

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

🚀 Getting Started

🔹 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system.git
cd recommendation-system

🔹 2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
🔹 3. Run the CLI Version

python recommender.py
🔹 4. Run the GUI Version (Tkinter)

python gui_app.py
🔹 5. Run the Web-Based Version (Flask)

python web_app.py
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.

🎯 How It Works

1️⃣ User provides input (e.g., favorite movie, book, or past purchases).

2️⃣ Collaborative Filtering finds users with similar tastes and recommends what they liked.

3️⃣ Content-Based Filtering analyzes item features and suggests similar items.

4️⃣ Hybrid System combines both approaches for the best recommendations.

🔥 Example Output (Movies Dataset)

Enter your favorite movie: Inception  
Recommended Movies:  
1. Interstellar  
2. The Matrix  
3. The Prestige  
4. Shutter Island  
5. The Dark Knight  

📌 The system understands your taste and finds the best matches!

🎯 Future Improvements

🔹 Enhance recommendation accuracy with Deep Learning

🔹 Support real-time recommendations with live user feedback

🔹 Deploy as a cloud-based API for large-scale applications

🔹 Add voice-based recommendations using NLP
